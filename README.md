# Better Google Docs

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/decemberthedeveloper)

## Abstract
This Chrome browser extension makes some improvements to Google Docs. Currently it hides the `@` shortcut menu while there's an active cursor.

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the Google Docs icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Better Google Docs" along with a menu detailing the version number for the browser extension and a link to the Github page.

When you navigate to a Google doc and have an active cursor on an empty line, you should no longer see the shortcut menu. 

## Screenshots


## Future Changes
In the future, I hope to port this extension to Firefox as well.
